## Hi there ðŸŒŠ 

I am Enio and this is my GitHub profile. I am currently a [PhD Candidate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Department of Marine Technology](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/enio.krizman). My current mission is in developing reliable and efficient methods for high-level mission planning and control execution of heterogeneous robotic platforms for long endurance autonomous mapping, inspection, and monitoring operations of the oceans and infrastructure. This involves leveraging online risk models and robotic organizations in conjunction with manned ships and remote operating centers. 

I am always open for collaboration in the fields of mission planning, guidance, and control of autonomous marine vehicles. You can contact me by [email](mailto:enio.krizman@ntnu.no) or on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/enio-krizman-b1885b27a).
